### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
-----

I'm Kun Hwi, and I am a software engineer at Workday! I'm currently part of the Public Cloud Platform Team, where I actively am contributing to the development of various Kubernetes operators that build the next generation of Workday's cloud platform.

Recently, I've also been working on the development of [ACK controllers](https://github.com/aws-controllers-k8s), which is an open-source project led by AWS to manage various AWS services through Kubernetes.

I have a particular interest for computer networking and modern cloud technologies and am always striving to learn something new every day.

Here on my GitHub, I openly share what I know about distributed systems and modern cloud tools. Feel free to also view some of my past projects :)

Always looking forward to connecting with others!
